Two NFL prediction models for NFL week 13 2025 using the KNN algorithm
Two NFL prediction models for NFL week 13 2025 using the KNN algorithm with scraped historical data from the 2022-2024 seasons. These are classification models with discrete categories. When setting the model, using 7 as the value of K produced the highest accuracy opposed to 5, 6, 8, 9, ect.  The value 7 in the KNN model essentially means we are clustering 7 of the closest games and making a prediction based on a majority vote on the outcomes of those 7 games. The tuned model is basically the same code but tuned with a pipeline and a scaler imported from scikit learn to remove novelty data and improve the accuracy of the model.
